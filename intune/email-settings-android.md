# Email profile settings for devices running Android and Android Enterprise - Intune

Use the email profile settings to configure your devices running Android.

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign email settings to the following Android devices:

- Android Samsung Knox Standard
- Android Enterprise

## Android (Samsung Knox)

- **Email server**: Enter the host name of your Exchange server.
- **Account name**: Enter the display name for the email account. This name is shown to users on their devices.
- **Username attribute from AAD**: This name is the attribute Intune gets from Azure Active Directory (AAD). Intune dynamically generates the username that's used by this profile. Your options:
  - **User Principal Name**: Gets the name, such as `user1` or `user1@contoso.com`
  - **User name**: Gets only the name, such as `user1`
  - **sAM Account Name**: Requires the domain, such as `domain\user1`. sAM account name can only be used with Android devices. Android Enterprise isn't supported.

    Also enter:  
    - **User domain name source**: Choose **AAD** (Azure Active Directory) or **Custom**.

      When choosing to get the attributes from **AAD**, enter:
      - **User domain name attribute from AAD**: Choose to get the **Full domain name** or the **NetBIOS name** attribute of the user

      When choosing to use **Custom** attributes, enter:
      - **Custom domain name to use**: Enter a value that Intune uses for the domain name, such as `contoso.com` or `contoso`

- **Email address attribute from AAD**: Choose how the email address for the user is generated. Select **User principal name** (`user1@contoso.com` or `user1`) to use the full principal name as the email address, or **Primary SMTP address** (`user1@contoso.com`) to use the primary SMTP address to sign in to Exchange.

- **Authentication method**: Select either **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
  - If you select **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.

### Security settings

- **SSL**: Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.
- **S/MIME**: Send outgoing email using S/MIME encryption.
  - If you select **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.

### Synchronization settings

- **Amount of email to synchronize**: Choose the number of days of email that you want to synchronize, or select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Sync schedule**: Select the schedule for devices to synchronize data from the Exchange server. You can also select **As Messages arrive**, which synchronizes data when it arrives, or **Manual**, where the user of the device must initiate the synchronization.

### Content sync settings

- **Content type to sync**: Select the content types that you want to synchronize to devices from:
  - **Contacts**
  - **Calendar**
  - **Tasks**
  
    **NOTE**: Be aware that the option "Not Configured" for the Email Profile settings is equal to "Disable".

## Android Enterprise

- **Email app**: Select either **Gmail** or **Nine Work**
- **Email server**: The host name of your Exchange server.
- **Username attribute from AAD**: This name is the attribute in Active Directory (AD) or Azure AD, that is used to generate the username for this email profile. Select **Primary SMTP Address**, such as user1@contoso.com or **User Principal Name**, such as user1 or user1@contoso.com.
- **Email address attribute from AAD**: How the email address for the user on each device is generated. Select **User Principal Name** to use the full principal name as the email address or **User name**.
- **Authentication method**: Select either **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
  - If you selected **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.
- **SSL**: Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.
- **Amount of email to synchronize**: Choose the number of days of email that you want to synchronize, or select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Content type to sync** (Nine Work only): Select the content types that you want to synchronize to devices from:
  - **Contacts**
  - **Calendar**
  - **Tasks**
